# Objective with the project

Project Description: Basic Implementation of the PagSeguro API with NEXT.js

This project aims to implement the PagSeguro API in a basic way, taking advantage of the NEXT.js framework and the Axios library to make API calls. Additionally, GSAP will be used to create dynamic and attractive animations.

To test the payment, simply use the test cards provided in the documentation: [`Cartões de teste Pagseguro`](https://dev.pagbank.uol.com.br/docs/cartoes-de-teste)
